# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
The script will execute the following steps:

Load and preprocess the heart disease dataset.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including KNN, XGBoost, Random Forest, and more.
Perform cross-validation to assess the models' performance.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models' parameters.
Output the evaluation metrics and predictions for the best-performing model.
Explore the results and evaluation metrics:

The script will display the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for each model.
The predictions for the best-performing model can be found in the predictions.csv file.
Future Scope
The Heart Disease Prediction Model project provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and future developments. Some potential areas of future improvement and expansion include:

Integration of additional machine learning algorithms and models to explore their performance and compare them with the existing ones.
Enhancing the preprocessing pipeline to handle new types of input features and improve data normalization techniques.
Building a web or mobile application for users to input their personal health data and receive personalized heart disease risk predictions.
Incorporating real-time data collection from wearable devices or health monitoring systems to provide continuous heart disease risk assessment.
Implementing explainable AI techniques to provide insights and explanations for the predictions, aiding in better decision-making by healthcare professionals.
